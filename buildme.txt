This is no shit build me guide.

You can set up this on any machine by just changing the setEnv.cmd, run it and
you are done. Or you are an old type, you can tweak your own Windows registry
and have fun doing that again on your new machine/other machine(s).

To run the build:

gradlew

To generate Eclipse project:

gradlew eclipse

Enjoy!
